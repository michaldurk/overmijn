My learning started in primary school. After eight years of primary school, I passed the exams for a five-year technical school in the Electromechanical School Complex in the field of industrial automation electrical engineering, where I defended my final thesis programming the DSM 51 microprocessor model for intersections.
During this school, I got to know non-ferro and ferromagnetic metals, metal production technology, chemistry (extended program), electrical engineering, electrical measurement at an extended level. I also completed two-year courses combining computer graphics and logistic
Unfortunately, my family was not wealthy and we could not afford further education. For five years after school, I worked in a hypermarket warehouse to improve our financial situation.
I'm 40 years old and spend most of my time in warehouses and demolishing factories. I would love to help if I could.
